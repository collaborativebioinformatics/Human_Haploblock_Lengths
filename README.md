## üéØ Aim  
To construct a **consensus map of haploblock breakpoints** by integrating **trio-based haplotype-resolved assemblies** with **pangenome graph methods**, and to explore how **structural variants (SVs)** affect haploblock length distributions.  

**Desired MVP (Minimum Viable Product):**  
- Jupyter notebook ‚Üí graph construction ‚Üí parse recombination breakpoints  
- Haploblock length estimation ‚Üí clustering ‚Üí visualization of hotspots

## üìñ Introduction  

The concept of **haploblocks** (blocks of DNA inherited without recombination) is central to human genetics.  
- Traditional **HapMap studies** estimated haploblocks at ~50‚Äì100 kb.  
- However, large **structural variants (SVs)** (>2 Mb) disrupt haploblock boundaries and can cause many true haploblocks to be invisible in population-level LD-based maps.  

**Why this matters:**  
- **Haploblock = minimal unit of inheritance**  
- Trio-based assemblies allow direct identification of **recombination breakpoints**  
- **Pangenome graphs** (HPRC, T2T-CHM13) capture structural variation missed by linear references  
- Together, these resources allow us to build **fine-scale haploblock maps** and compare them with **population recombination maps** (e.g., deCODE)

## üõ†Ô∏è Methods  

The analysis focused on chr6:70‚Äì80 Mb in the Ashkenazim Trio (HG002 child, HG003 father, HG004 mother).  
- **Data sources:** GIAB v4.2.1 VCFs + chr6 reference FASTA  
- **Tools:** bcftools, samtools, Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, biopython)  
- **Steps:**  
  1. Filter and merge trio VCFs  
  2. Assign parental origin of child‚Äôs heterozygous alleles  
  3. Collapse consecutive origins into haploblocks  
  4. Identify recombination breakpoints  
  5. Generate consensus hap1, hap2, and IUPAC FASTAs  
  6. Visualize haploblocks, block size distribution, and variant density

## üöÄ Future Directions  

This workflow establishes a proof-of-concept for fine-scale recombination mapping in human trios. Future directions include scaling the analysis to the whole genome and across multiple trios to generate population-level recombination landscapes. The integration of long-read assemblies and trio-aware phasing algorithms will refine haploblock boundaries, while the adoption of pangenome graph references will allow hotspot detection in structurally complex regions that are inaccessible to linear references. Linking recombination hotspots with regulatory annotations and disease-associated loci will further bridge evolutionary insights with clinical genomics. Longer-term, the pipeline can be extended into a reproducible open-source framework, enabling machine learning approaches to predict recombination patterns from sequence features and epigenomic signals.
